# Predicting Online News Popularity

## Executive Summary 

In todayâ€™s digital world, most companies attempt to accomplish virality, because it provides great impact at a fraction of the cost. This study attempts to predict if an online article will be popular in terms of the number of shares it will get. This study used the statistics of Mashable online article from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The study was able to predict news popularity with a 97% accuracy, 98% f1 score for unpopular articles, and 72% f1 score for popular articles using SMOTEENN and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The study was able to identify the top predictors of popular articles and the direction of each feature.

The findings of this study can be used by Mashable as a Decision Support Tool to guide its operations on engineering virality. The value of this tool is that the features used to predict the popularity can be extracted even before posting the article. This means that after going through the writing and editing process, they can test if the article will be popular using this tool. If the article will be unpopular, they have the option to edit it first guided by the insights from the SHAP summary plot.
